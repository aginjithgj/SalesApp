  - Display available stock while excluding deleted items.

- **Sales and Purchase Management**:
  - Track sales and purchase details with an intuitive interface.
  - Generate detailed reports on sales and purchases.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the SalesApp project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2019 or later
- .NET Framework 4.8
- SQL Server (2016 or later)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aginjithgj/SalesApp.git
   ```
2. **Open the Project**:
   - Open `SalesApp.sln` in Visual Studio.

3. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
   - Run the `SalesAppDB.sql` script located in the `Database` folder to create the database and tables.

4. **Update the Connection String**:
   - In `web.config`, update the connection string to match your SQL Server instance:
     ```xml
     <connectionStrings>
       <add name="SalesAppDB"
            connectionString="Data Source=your_server_name;Initial Catalog=SalesAppDB;Integrated Security=True;"
            providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
     </connectionStrings>
     ```

5. **Build and Run**:
   - Build the project using Visual Studio (`Ctrl + Shift + B`).
   - Start the application (`F5` or `Ctrl + F5`).

## Usage

1. **Login**: Start the application, and log in using default credentials (admin:admin). You can update these credentials later.
2. **Manage Products**: Navigate to the "Products" section to add or update product details.
3. **Manage Purchases**: Use the "Purchases" page to add purchase details and update stock levels.
4. **Sales Management**: Add sales transactions and review sales reports.

## Soft Delete Mechanism

The project uses a **soft delete** approach, where records are not physically removed from the database. Instead, a `Deleted` column is updated to mark the record as inactive. This ensures data integrity and allows for recovery if needed.
